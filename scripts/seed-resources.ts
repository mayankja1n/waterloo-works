		description: "A webring connecting personal websites of Software Engineering students at the University of Waterloo. Increase discoverability and traffic to your portfolio through this centralized directory.",
		content: `# SE Webring

A webring for Software Engineering students at the University of Waterloo - bringing back the spirit of the 90s web to connect student portfolios and personal sites.

## What's a Webring?

A webring is a collection of websites linked together by a common theme. Historically popular in the 1990s as a search engine optimization technique, the SE Webring revives this concept to provide a **central directory for personal websites and portfolios** of current and former Software Engineering students at the University of Waterloo, making them more discoverable and driving traffic to individual sites.

## How It Works

The SE Webring is a **static, client-side application with no backend** - all functionality runs directly in your browser:

### Core Technology
- **Data Layer**: All sites stored in \`js/sites.js\` as a simple JavaScript array
- **Search**: Fuzzy search powered by Fuse.js (search by name, year, or website)
- **Visualization**: Interactive 3D torus animation built with Three.js
- **Hosting**: Deployed on Netlify with continuous deployment from GitHub
- **GitHub as CMS**: All contributions managed through pull requests

### Features
- 🔍 **Fuzzy Search**: Find students by name, cohort year, or website URL
- 🎨 **3D Torus Animation**: Scroll-controlled visualization using WebGL
- 📦 **Client-Side Only**: No backend means simple hosting and fast performance
- 🔄 **Automated Workflow**: GitHub Actions label PRs automatically
- ⚡ **Instant Updates**: Merged changes deploy automatically to production

## How to Join

### Requirements
- Must be a **current student or alum** of UW Software Engineering undergraduate program
- Have a personal website or portfolio

### Submission Process
1. Fork the \`simcard0000/se-webring\` repository on GitHub
2. Add your entry to the **end** of the \`allSites\` array in \`js/sites.js\`:
   \`\`\`javascript
   {
     name: "Your Full Name",
     year: 2025,  // Your cohort year
     website: "https://yoursite.com"
   }
   \`\`\`
3. Open a pull request with:
   - Your full name
   - Cohort year
   - Full website URL
   - Link to another profile for identity verification (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
4. Wait for review - PRs are approved if all requirements are met and content is appropriate

**Pro Tip**: Add a mention or link to the SE Webring on your submitted site to support the community!

## Technical Details

### Browser Requirements
- ES Modules support
- WebGL support
- CSS \`position: sticky\`
- Import maps

### Stack
- Vanilla JavaScript with ES Modules
- Fuse.js for fuzzy search
